        <h2>DANDY IN THE UNDERWORLD</h2>
        <h2>5.5% ABV The main Dandy</h2>
        This beer is our most popular offering and available everywhere, all the time. A light body with notes of coffee, chocolate,
         and light roast, this traditional Oyster Stout is sure to be a favourite.
        
        Pairs well with oysters, fish, and other salty snacks.
        
        <h3>7.3% ABV THE DANDY WILD SOUR ALE</h3>
        A bold, malty sour ale soured with lacto-bacillus and fermented with a wild yeast strain. An upfront sourness is balanced with notes of
        green mango, Sauvignon Blanc, and pineapple.
        
        <h4>7.5% ABV T2G-IPA</h4>
        A bold IPA that is all sorts of Dandy. Choosing not to take sides, this rich IPA has a present bitterness balanced with a juicy
         citrus aroma.
        
        <h5>5% ABV DANDY LAGER</h5>     
        
        An import style premium lager brewed with toasted rice and the finest Alberta malt. Thoughtfully hopped with prime German hops, for a
         subtle citrus aroma, this beer is crisp and fresh. Premium in name, Dandy in Nature.
        
        <h1>RELEASES</h1>
        
        <h6>FOUR EXCITING BEERS A YEAR WITH WIDE RELEASE.
        LOOK FOR THEM WHEN THE WEATHER BEGINS TO TURN.</h6>
        
        <h5>BALTUS VAN TASSEL: CHERRY SOUR, 7% ABV FALL</h5>
        An American Style Cherry Sour.  A rich brown American Brown sour brewed with Sweet and Tart cherries for the perfect accompaniment to
        shorter days and colder weather.
        
        <h5>IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER: BLACK IPA, 6.5% ABV WINTER</h5>
         A fruity Black IPA. With only a kiss of roast, this black IPA is fresh and juicy but dark as the coldest days of winter. Citra and 
         Mosaic are late hop additions to avoid the biterness and focus on aroma.
        
         <h5>THE JUNGLE BIRD: TROPICAL DARK SOUR, 5% ABV SPRING</h5>
        An homage to the classic Tiki cocktail. This beer has notes of demerara sugar, bitter lime, tropical pineapple coming together for a
        refreshing sour that is like no other.
        
        <h5>BRIGHT YOUNG THINGS: HOPPED WHEAT ALE, 5.5% ABV SUMMER</h5>
        English Summer Ale. A style developed during a late 70’s heat wave in England, this beer is designed to refresh in the hot summer sun.
        Dry, with a touch of wheat and toasted Victory malt, it is balanced with a touch of biterness and
        a sweet citrus aroma. Patios, BBQ’s, and friends all pair perfectly with this beer!

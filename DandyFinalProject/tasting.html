What We Do
The Dandy Brewing Company and Tasting Room is a unique experience located in the heart of Ramsay.
The modern space features 20 taps of Dandy Beers (maybe a few rad guest taps), a curated cocktail list
featuring local spirit, a daily selection of top quality wines available by the glass.
Making the experience even better is a menu of drinking food, rooted in the fine dining. Chef Merritt
Gordon has put together something amazing, enhancing the already indulgent experience.
Open Daily for lunch and dinner service, as well as brunch on weekends.
